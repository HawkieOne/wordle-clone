A clone of Wordle, a word game by New York Times. The task in the game is to 
guess which the word of the day is. You have 6 guesses and after every guess you get which letters
in the word thet you guessed were in the right position, in the wrong position or not in the word. My clone is similar to the original wordle but there are some differences. For example you can play how many times you want in the clone.

This Wordle Clone offers the same functionality as the original game. You can write letters to form words through either a keyboard or by pressing the visual keyboard on the screen. This works on mobile as well. When you have written a word you can guess that that word is the correct word. If you only writes four letter you will get a visual error of this. If your word does not exist in the english dictionary you will also get a visual error of this. When you have guessed the correct word you will see some statistics of all your wordle clone games.

There is not any game breaking issus that are known. Some future further development areas is improving the light mode and add better animations.

This project was done in the spring of 2022 as a hobby project. I had been playing Wordle and came up with the idea myself. The app is built from the ground by only me and by no help of any tutorials.
